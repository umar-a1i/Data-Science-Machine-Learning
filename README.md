This is a repository for Machine Learning

## Overview of ML

This is a summation of my basic understanding of Machine Learning.

You can see the document about my understanding of Machine Learning here [Overview_of_ML](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## Data Exploration

This is a C++ file going through a basic statistical analysis of two columns of data.

You can find the C++ file here [Data_Exploration](Data_Exploration.cpp), and you can find a document about exploring data [here](Data_Exploration.pdf)

## Linear Models

These are two pdf files created in R exploring linear regression, logistic regression, and naive bias.

You can find the pdf file of linear regression [here](Regression.pdf), and you can find the pdf file for logistic regression and naive bias [here](Classification.pdf)

## Machine Learning Algortihms from Scratch

This is a C++ file implementing the use of Naive Bayes on the survivability of each member of the titanic

You can find the C++ file here [naive_bayes.cpp](naive_bayes.cpp).
