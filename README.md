This is a repository for Machine Learning

## Overview of ML

This is a summation of my basic understanding of Machine Learning.

You can see the document about my understanding of Machine Learning here [Overview_of_ML](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## Data Exploration

This is a C++ file going through a basic statistical analysis of two columns of data.

You can find the C++ file here [Data_Exploration](Data_Exploration.cpp), and you can find a document about exploring data [here](Data_Exploration.pdf)

## Linear Models

These are two pdf files created in R exploring linear regression, logistic regression, and naive bias.

You can find the pdf file of linear regression [here](Regression.pdf), and you can find the pdf file for logistic regression and naive bias [here](Classification.pdf)

## Machine Learning Algortihms from Scratch

There are 2 C++ files implementing the use of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression on the survivability of each member of the titanic.

You can find the C++ files here [naive_bayes.cpp](naive_bayes.cpp) and [logistic_reg.cpp](logistic_reg.cpp)

Here is a document about my understanding of ML algorithms from scratch [ML_Algorithms.pdf](ML_Algorithms.pdf)

## Searching for Similarities

There are 4 pdf files about implementing classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

You can find classification [here](Notebook1.pdf), regression [here](Notebook2_1.pdf), clustering [here](Clustering.pdf), and dimensionality reduction [here](Notebook4.pdf).

Here is a document about my understanding of [Searching_for_Similarities](SearchingforSimilarity.pdf).

## Support Vector Machine

There are 3 pdf files about SVM classification, regression, and Ensemble Techniques.

You can find SVM Regression [here](Notebook_1_Regression.pdf), SVM Classification [here](Notebook_2_Classification.pdf), and Ensemble Techniques [here](Notebook3_EM.nb.pdf).

Here is a document about my understanding of [Support Vector Machines](SVM.pdf).

## ML with Sklearn

There is a pdf file about ML with sklearn in Python, you can find it [here](ML_sklearn.pdf).
